#  Tennis game Deep Q Network (DQN) approach using reinforcement learning 

### Description

```

1. There are 2 players (2 agents) with a tennisball.

2. There is a lawn of tennis  with dimension (x, y) - (300, 500)

3. The tennisball moves on a straight line, such that player A decides a target point between x1 (0) and x2 (300) of side B (Player B side),  therefore it shows the tennisball 50 different times with respect to an Frames Per Second of 20.

###  Discrete mathematics

It uses the y = mx + c method to forecast new tennis ball locations


### To run program follow the process below:


To clone the work and run the main.py file using the following commands below
